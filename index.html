    <img id="picoast" src="images/Plum_Island_MA_South_Beach_DSC_0262_AD.jfif" alt="A picture of Plum Islands South Breach" >
    <p id="mypast">I grew up on the northern shores of Massachusetts on an barrier island called unimaginatively 
        Plum Island. One of my little joys of young adulthood was watching silence of the lambs and having Clarice say she's 
        sending hannibal to my home town. It's a different island in the movie but I enjoyed it. 
        To my east about a thousand walking feet away was the shoreline and to my west was a great expanse
        of marsh that would roll with the tide. Clam flats at low tide can be objectionable to some but that combined 
        with the smell of the sea just smells like home to me. I've swam in the ocean plenty when I wasn't dodging the
        biting flies that are native to the area called greenheads and man do they hurt. I've only been out on a big boat
        to sea twice in my life however. I got a little sea sick, which is wierd for me since I don't normally get motion
        sick, but only a little. I lost my dad young which has had a profound effect on my life. He was kind of my only friend
        in a very lonely and confusing schooling experience. He went suddenly from a coronary so it was quite a shock to the 
        system and took me some years to fully recover from. My schooling was primarily in the vocational mode. I learned to 
        work with my hands and hands and to build things. I like that, the building a complete product from some materials that 
       were basic or simple things. I was in the electrical engineering program so I learned a lot about the
       ideas about the control and adjustment of this natural phenomenon. I feel like coding does much the
        the same thing as with data it is controlled by a program in a computer. Things can go disaterously wrong if
        you don't account for your voltages correctly or in the case of code your loop runs on into infinity.
        I spent much of my free time in the Boy Scouts during this period and thoroughly learned to love nature
        and camping. I worked hard and earned many of the society's commendations that earned me the rank of 
        Eagle scout, the highest rank. I learned a lot about self sufficency and leadership while I was earning
        those ranks. I worked several jobs both in offices and in labs after high school, but what I always
        wanted to be doing was to work with computers. I went back to school to try and learn the traditional
        way and that went not so well. I just didn't find the education I wanted there and so I looked elsewhere.

    <h1 class="Headers">How its going</h1>
    <p id="mypresent">I had learned a bit about coding basics and I still wanted to code so I went with Coding Temple
        as a bootcamp to get myself up to speed for the vocation. I have been learning a lot in a different way then
        in the past. Python is much more dynamic than C or Java. So there is a lot of space to be creative with ease. 
        Learning git has been great so far as it presents a great tool set for cooperation and iteration on what you
        have previously done.
