    <h1 id="Headers">How it started</h1>
    <p id="mypast">My schooling was primarily in the vocational mode. I learned to work with my hands and 
       hands and to build things. I like that, the building a complete product from some materials that 
       were basic or simple things. I was in the electrical engineering program so I learned a lot about the
       ideas about the control and adjustment of this natural phenomenon. I feel like coding does much the
        the same thing as data is controlled by a program in a computer. Things can go disaterously wrong if
        you don't account for your voltages correctly or in the case of code your loop runs on into infinity.
        I spent much of my free time in the Boy Scouts during this period and thoroughly learned to love nature
        and camping. I worked hard and earned many of the society's commendations that earned me the rank of 
        Eagle scout, the highest rank. I learned a lot about self sufficency and leadership while I was earning
        those ranks. I worked several jobs both in offices and in labs after high school, but what I always
        wanted to be doing was to work with computers. I went back to school to try and learn the traditional
        way and that went not so well. I just didn't find the education I wanted there and so I looked elsewhere.

    <h1 id="Headers">How its going</h1>
    <p id="mypresent">I had learned a bit about coding basics and I still wanted to code so I went with Coding Temple
        as a bootcamp to get myself up to speed for the vocation. I have been learning a lot in a different way then
        in the past. Python is much more dynamic than C or Java. So there is a lot of space to be creative with ease. 
        Learning git has been great so far as it presents a great tool set for cooperation and iteration on what you
        have previously done.
